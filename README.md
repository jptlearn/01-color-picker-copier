# Color Picker and Color Copier

## Color Picker Interface Types

The application provides multiple ways to select colors through different interface types:

### 1. Color Wheel

- A circular interface that displays the full color spectrum in a wheel format
- Allows intuitive color selection by clicking anywhere on the wheel

### 2. Image Based Color Picker

- Includes eyedropper tool for sampling colors from images
- Supports color picking from uploaded images or screen content
- Real-time color preview while hovering

### 3. Slider-Based Controls

- RGB sliders for precise control of Red, Green and Blue values
- HSL sliders for Hue, Saturation and Lightness adjustment
- Numeric input fields for direct value entry

### 4. Quick Selection Tools

- Gradient bars for smooth transitions between colors
- Pre-defined color palette grids for common colors
- Recently used colors section for quick access
- Color harmony tools for finding complementary colors

## Color Format Support

The application supports multiple color formats for maximum compatibility:

### RGB Format

- Standard RGB color model
- Format: `rgb(255, 0, 0)`
- Each channel ranges from 0-255
- Example: `rgb(255, 0, 0)` represents pure red

### HSL Format

- Intuitive Hue, Saturation, Lightness model
- Format: `hsl(0, 100%, 50%)`
- Hue: 0-360Â°, Saturation & Lightness: 0-100%
- Example: `hsl(0, 100%, 50%)` represents pure red

### Hexadecimal Format

- Web standard hex color codes
- Format: `#RRGGBB`
- Each channel ranges from 00-FF
- Example: `#FF0000` represents pure red

## Copy Functionality

The application provides multiple feedback mechanisms when copying colors:

### Visual Feedback

- Status bar updates with copied value

### System Integration

- Support for keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+C / Cmd+C)
- Audible feedback sounds on copy
- Clipboard integration for pasting elsewhere

### Logic Roadmap

### Logic Implementation

The application follows a modular architecture for maintainable code:

### Core Functionality

- Real-time color input monitoring and preview updates
- Seamless color format conversions (RGB, HSL, HEX)
- Synchronized field updates across all formats
- One-click copy functionality with visual feedback
- Status notifications for user actions

### File Structure

The codebase is organized into focused modules:

- `app.js` - Core application logic and event handling
- `colorUtils.js` - Color conversion and manipulation utilities
